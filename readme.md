This is a clone of their web access module used for learning purposes. The database used is confidential, and so the screenshots are only a proof of the PHP code working as intended.

# Notes

I have learned many things during this internship period made possible the BKSM company. I practiced my web design skills by creating a website clone and learned a new language which is PHP and SQL who helped me deal with some server-side and database stuff which allowed me to dig my way more in backend, a field where I thrive in. I am grateful for this progression and look forward to my future where I would be able to bring more solutions to the world.

# Acknowledgments

A special thanks to the BKSM team for the opportunity that has been given to me. The ICodeThis community server discord for helping me with a bunch of PHP code (SkinnyK, Chris, Andrei) and Wiru, the friend who motivated me going all in even when I didn't feel like it.
